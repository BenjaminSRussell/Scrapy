## 🏁 Quick Start

Ready to see the magic happen? Just a few commands and you're off!

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Scrapy
./run_the_scrape
```

**That's it!** The script handles everything from setup to completion. ✅

---

## 🎯 What It Does

This pipeline discovers, validates, and enriches web content with NLP, turning raw data into valuable insights.

```
Seed URLs → 🌐 Discovery → ✨ Validation → 🧠 Enrichment → 📊 Final Output
  (CSV)      (25K URLs)   (22K valid)   (NLP data)   (JSONL)
```

**Your final, enriched data is waiting for you at:** `Scraping_project/data/processed/stage03/enriched_content.jsonl`

## 📺 Real-Time Visualization

Why wait for results when you can see the progress live? Our terminal-based visualization keeps you in the loop with smooth animations.

## 🛠️ Usage

Get more control over the pipeline with these commands:

```bash
# Run the full pipeline from start to finish
./run_the_scrape

# Run a specific stage (e.g., stage 1)
./run_the_scrape --stage 1

# Skip the installation if you've already set it up
./run_the_scrape --skip-install
```

## 📄 Output Example

Here’s a sneak peek at the beautifully structured data you'll get:

```json
{
  "url": "https://uconn.edu/academics",
  "title": "Academics - UConn",
  "entities": ["University of Connecticut"],
  "keywords": ["academics", "programs"],
  "categories": ["education"],
  "word_count": 1234
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a hybrid Python and Java architecture.

1.  **🐍 Python Scraper (`Scraping_project/`):** A 3-stage Scrapy-based pipeline that discovers, validates, and enriches web content.
2.  **☕ Java ETL Loader (`Scraping_project/java-etl-loader/`):** A Spring Boot app that loads the final JSONL output into a PostgreSQL data warehouse.

> **Note:** The mixed-language approach is a work in progress. We plan to migrate the Java ETL process to Python for a more unified system.
