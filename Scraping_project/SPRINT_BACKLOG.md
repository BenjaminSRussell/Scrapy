# Sprint Backlog: UConn Scraper Enhancements

## Epic: NLP and Enrichment Enhancements

**Goal:** Enhance the scraped content categorization with a detailed taxonomy and improve keyword extraction with UConn-specific terminology.

---

### User Story
As a data consumer, I want the scraped content to be categorized with a detailed and comprehensive set of tags so that I can easily find and analyze information on specific topics.

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define a University-Wide Taxonomy
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 5 Story Points
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Research and define a hierarchical list of 50-100 categories and sub-categories that represent the entire university. This will serve as the foundation for the new classification system.

**Affected Files:**
- New file: `data/config/taxonomy.json`

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] A JSON or YAML file containing the complete taxonomy is created
- [x] Taxonomy includes 50-100 categories covering all major university domains
- [x] Categories are hierarchically structured (parent/child relationships)
- [x] File is committed to the repository

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Taxonomy covers: Academics, Research, Student Services, Administrative, Athletics, Healthcare, etc.
- ✅ Each category has a unique identifier and human-readable label
- ✅ Structure is validated and parseable

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `data/config/taxonomy.json` with 15 main categories and 66 subcategories
- Covers all major university domains with comprehensive keyword lists
- Fully integrated with Stage 3 enrichment spider

### Task 2: Implement Zero-Shot Classification in Stage 3
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 8 Story Points
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Integrate a HuggingFace zero-shot classification model into the Stage 3 enrichment process. Use the new taxonomy to classify the content of each page.

**Affected Files:**
- [src/stage3/enrichment_spider.py](src/stage3/enrichment_spider.py)
- [src/common/nlp.py](src/common/nlp.py)
- [src/common/schemas.py](src/common/schemas.py)

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] `EnrichmentItem` schema uses `content_tags` field for categories
- [x] Taxonomy-based classification is integrated (keyword matching + optional zero-shot)
- [x] Stage 3 spider populates `content_tags` field with classification results
- [x] Classification results include matched keywords and scores
- [x] Functions are tested and working in production

**Technical Notes:**
- ✅ Implemented `classify_with_taxonomy()` function in `src/common/nlp.py`
- ✅ Supports optional zero-shot classification via HuggingFace transformers
- ✅ Configuration supports model selection and device (CPU/GPU)

**Implementation Details:**
- Created keyword-based classification using taxonomy
- Integrated with `classify_text()` function for optional zero-shot classification
- Configured in `config/development.yml` with model: `MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v2.0`
- Categories automatically extracted and added to `content_tags` field

### Task 3: Create a Custom Glossary for UConn-Specific Terms
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 5 Story Points
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Compile a list of important, UConn-specific terms (e.g., "HuskyCT," building names, course codes) and add a lookup process in Stage 3 to ensure they are always identified as keywords.

**Affected Files:**
- [src/stage3/enrichment_spider.py](src/stage3/enrichment_spider.py)
- [src/common/nlp.py](src/common/nlp.py)
- New file: `data/config/uconn_glossary.json`

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Glossary file with UConn-specific terms is created
- [x] Glossary includes: platform names, building names, department abbreviations, course codes
- [x] NLP pipeline in Stage 3 is augmented with custom glossary lookup
- [x] Extracted keywords are more accurate and relevant to UConn
- [x] Functions are tested and working

**Example Glossary Terms:**
- ✅ Platforms: HuskyCT, StudentAdmin, PeopleSoft, NetID
- ✅ Buildings: Gampel Pavilion, Homer Babbidge Library, Storrs Hall, John Dempsey Hospital
- ✅ Departments: CLAS, SoE, SoB, CAHNR, Neag School
- ✅ Services: JDH (John Dempsey Hospital), CETL, DOS, CSD, UCPD

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `data/config/uconn_glossary.json` with 100+ terms across 10 categories
- Implemented `extract_glossary_terms()` function in `src/common/nlp.py`
- Glossary terms are merged with NLP-extracted keywords (glossary terms prioritized)
- Supports term aliases for variations (e.g., "Husky CT" → "HuskyCT")

## Additional Enhancements Implemented

### ✅ Smarter Text Extraction
**Status:** Completed

**Description:** Improved text extraction to remove navigation, footer, header, and other non-content elements before NLP processing.

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced XPath selectors in `enrichment_spider.py` to exclude:
  - `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<header>` elements
  - Elements with `role="navigation"`, `role="menu"`, `role="banner"`
  - Elements with classes containing "nav", "menu", "footer", "sidebar"
- Result: Only main content is processed, dramatically improving keyword quality

### ✅ Entity Post-Processing Filters
**Status:** Completed

**Description:** Added filtering to remove nonsensical or invalid entities from NLP results.

**Implementation:**
- Created `filter_entities()` function in `src/common/nlp.py`
- Filters remove:
  - Entities longer than 6 words
  - Entities containing newline characters
  - Duplicate entities (case-insensitive)
  - Entities without letters
  - Numeric/punctuation-only entities
- Applied to both spaCy and transformer entity extraction

### ✅ NLP Model Upgrade Support
**Status:** Completed

**Description:** Added support for larger spaCy models and transformer-based NLP.

**Implementation:**
- Updated `config/development.yml` with model selection options:
  - `en_core_web_sm` (13MB, fast)
  - `en_core_web_md` (40MB, better accuracy)
  - `en_core_web_lg` (560MB, best accuracy)
  - `en_core_web_trf` (438MB, transformer-based, highest accuracy)
- Added transformer NER support via HuggingFace
- GPU/CPU device auto-detection and configuration
