"""Tests for main orchestrator module.

NOTE: These tests are outdated and need to be rewritten to match the current sync implementation.
The main.py module was refactored to use sync functions (run_stage1_discovery_sync, main_sync)
instead of async functions (run_stage1_discovery, run_stage2_validation, run_stage3_enrichment, main).

TODO: Rewrite tests to match current implementation.
