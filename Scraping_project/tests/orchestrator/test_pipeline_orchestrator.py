"""Tests for Pipeline Orchestrator"""

# TODO: Implement pipeline orchestrator tests
# Need to test:
# 1. BatchQueue operations (put, get_batch, backpressure)
# 2. Concurrent producer/consumer pattern
# 3. Queue size limits and overflow handling
# 4. Stage result loading and processing
# 5. Pipeline coordination between stages
# 6. Error handling and recovery
