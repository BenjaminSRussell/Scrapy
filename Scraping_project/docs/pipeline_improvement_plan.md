# Pipeline Improvement Plan - Comprehensive Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The UConn scraping pipeline has a solid foundation with a three-stage architecture, but needs significant improvements in scalability, reliability, and operational visibility. This plan prioritizes critical fixes first, then builds towards advanced features and monitoring capabilities.

## Current Architecture Strengths

✅ **Clean separation of concerns** - Discovery, Validation, Enrichment stages are well-defined
✅ **Async foundation** - Uses aiohttp and asyncio for concurrent processing
✅ **Configuration-driven** - YAML-based configs for different environments
✅ **Domain safety** - Built-in canonicalization and domain restrictions
✅ **Extensible NLP** - Shared utilities for entity extraction and content analysis

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 🚨 Priority 1: Schema & Data Consistency

**Problem**: Data schemas are inconsistent between stages, causing runtime failures

**Impact**:
- Stage 2 produces `url_hash` field but `ValidationResult` schema lacks it
- Stage 3 can't properly join data due to missing hash keys
- Lineage tracking fails, making debugging impossible

**Solution Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
```python
# Fix ValidationResult schema
@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    url_hash: str  # ADD THIS FIELD
    url: str
    status_code: int
    # ... existing fields
```

**Action Items**:
1. Add `url_hash` to ValidationResult dataclass
2. Update Stage 1 to persist hash in JSONL output
3. Ensure Stage 3 reads and propagates hash correctly
4. Add schema validation tests to prevent regression

### 🔧 Priority 2: Stage 3 Orchestration Repair

**Problem**: Stage 3 CLI is broken - can't run `python main.py --stage 3`

**Impact**:
- Manual Scrapy commands required for enrichment
- Inconsistent configuration handling
- No integrated monitoring of Stage 3 progress

**Solution Timeline**: 1 week
- Replace subprocess Scrapy calls with direct async orchestration
- Fix `urls_for_enrichment` undefined reference
- Ensure output paths match configuration

### 💾 Priority 3: Persistent Deduplication

**Problem**: URL deduplication happens in memory, doesn't survive restarts

**Impact**:
- Large crawls consume excessive memory (>1GB for 100K URLs)
- Crashes lose all deduplication state
- Restart replays entire crawl from beginning

**Solution Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- Migrate to SQLite-based URLCache for persistence
- Implement checkpointing for recovery
- Add bloom filters for memory efficiency

## Operational Improvements

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability (Priority 4)

**Current Gap**: Only basic logging, no real-time metrics

**Needed Capabilities**:
- **Performance Dashboard**
  - URLs processed per second by stage
  - Queue depths and processing lag
  - Memory and CPU utilization trends
  - Error rates and success percentages

- **Business Metrics**
  - Discovery coverage (new URLs vs duplicates)
  - Validation success rates by domain/path
  - Content enrichment quality scores
  - Faculty profile completion rates

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Add metrics collection
class MetricsCollector:
    def record_stage_throughput(self, stage: int, count: int, duration: float)
    def record_error_rate(self, stage: int, errors: int, total: int)
    def record_queue_depth(self, queue_name: str, depth: int)

# Export to monitoring systems
class PrometheusExporter:
    def export_metrics(self, metrics: dict)
```

### 🔄 Error Handling & Recovery (Priority 5)

**Current State**: Basic exception catching, no sophisticated recovery

**Needed Patterns**:
- **Circuit Breaker**: Stop hitting failing endpoints
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Quarantine problematic URLs for manual review
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent retry with jitter
- **Error Classification**: Route different error types appropriately

**Implementation Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### 📈 Performance Optimization (Priority 6)

**Current Bottlenecks**:
1. **Memory Growth**: URL deduplication sets grow unbounded
2. **I/O Blocking**: JSONL file operations are synchronous
3. **CPU Usage**: Content processing not parallelized effectively

**Optimization Plan**:
```python
# Memory-efficient deduplication
class BloomFilterCache:
    def __init__(self, expected_items: int = 1_000_000):
        self.bloom = BloomFilter(capacity=expected_items)
        self.precise_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=10_000)

# Async I/O for file operations
async def write_jsonl_batch(items: list, filepath: Path):
    async with aiofiles.open(filepath, 'a') as f:
        for item in items:
            await f.write(json.dumps(item) + '\n')
```

## Feature Enhancements

### 🎓 Faculty Data Integration (Priority 7)

**Scope**: Comprehensive faculty directory scraping and enhancement

**Components**:
1. **Faculty Directory Crawler**
   - Parse department faculty pages
   - Extract contact information, research areas
   - Build comprehensive faculty database

2. **RateMyProfessor Integration**
   - Automated professor lookup and rating retrieval
   - Fuzzy name matching with confidence scoring
   - Privacy-compliant data handling

3. **Research Integration**
   - Publication database linking (Google Scholar, ORCID)
   - Grant information extraction
   - Collaboration network mapping

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

### 🔍 Advanced Content Analysis (Priority 8)

**Current State**: Basic NLP entity extraction

**Enhancement Plan**:
- **Content Quality Scoring**
  ```python
  class ContentQualityAnalyzer:
      def calculate_readability_score(self, text: str) -> float
      def detect_academic_relevance(self, content: str) -> float
      def identify_content_type(self, html: str) -> ContentType
  ```

- **Semantic Analysis**
  - Topic modeling for content categorization
