I've analyzed the `stage2` code and found several significant issues, primarily related to code duplication, over-engineering, and dangerous practices like monkey-patching. Here's a summary of my findings, which I will now save to `stage2_weird_aspects.md`.

### `enhanced_validator.py`

*   **Over-engineered:** This "enhanced" validator is a prime example of over-engineering. It includes complex features like intelligent retries, circuit breakers, and content classification, which add significant complexity.
*   **Complex Configuration:** The `__init__` method is a maze of nested configuration lookups, making it difficult to understand how the validator is configured.
*   **Redundant Caching:** It implements its own caching for processed URLs, which is redundant given the existing checkpointing system.
*   **Excessive Metadata:** The validator generates a large amount of metadata for the next stage, which, while useful, bloats the `ValidationResult` and adds complexity to this stage.

### `validator.py`

*   **Monkey-Patching `aiohttp`:** This file contains a dangerous and brittle monkey-patch for `aiohttp.ClientSSLError`. Modifying library code at runtime is a major anti-pattern and should be avoided at all costs.
*   **God Object:** The `URLValidator` class is a "god object" with too many responsibilities. It manages checkpoints, feedback, adaptive depth, link graph analysis, and freshness tracking, in addition to its core validation logic.
*   **Complex Prioritization Logic:** The `_prioritize_batch_by_importance` method uses a complex and potentially overkill system of PageRank and HITS scores to prioritize URLs.
*   **Inconsistent and Basic Retry Logic:** The retry logic is marked with a `TODO` as "very basic," which is ironic given the "enhanced" validator in the other file.

### Overall Summary of Weird Aspects

1.  **Code Duplication and Divergence:** The existence of two separate, divergent validators (`validator.py` and `enhanced_validator.py`) is a major red flag. It indicates a lack of clear architectural direction and poor code management.
2.  **Dangerous Monkey-Patching:** The monkey-patching in `validator.py` is a critical issue that could lead to unexpected behavior and break with library updates.
3.  **Overly Complex and "God" Objects:** Both validators are overly complex and have too many responsibilities, making them difficult to maintain, test, and reason about.
4.  **Inconsistent Implementations:** The two files have different and inconsistent implementations for features like retry logic and configuration.

In short, `stage2` is a mess. The two validators should be reconciled into a single, well-designed component, the monkey-patching must be removed, and the overall complexity should be reduced.
