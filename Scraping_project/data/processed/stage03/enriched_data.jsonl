Over the past three decades, we have built state-of-the-art facilities that foster imagination, cultivate relationships, and advance innovation. Like  UCONN 2000  and  21st Century UConn  before it,  Next Generation Connecticut , the state's 10-year, $1.5 billion initiative that began in 2014, transformed our facilities statewide, strengthening our research and education. The sampling of projects outlined below represents key investments that allowed UConn to maintain its world-class status for future generations.

The plan assessed buildings, sites, open space, and infrastructure systems to provide a framework for advancing aspirations of our institution and achieving goals set by its academic vision. The plan was comprehensive and integrated - optimizing an opportunity to create an environment where ideas, imagination, and creativity can flourish. Completed in 2015 and capitalizing on  Next Generation Connecticut's  focus on STEM education and growing the research enterprise, the Master Plan drove transformative change in every aspect of academic and student life with an emphasis on excellence, community, inspiration, and innovation.  A copy of the document is available for viewing at masterplan.uconn.edu. 2016 Peter J.  Werth Residence Hall A new 212,000-square-foot residential facility opened for the Fall 2016 semester for students participating in one of eight Living & Learning Communities at UConn who are developing skills in innovation and creativity to lead their generation. Construction began in November 2014 with a budget of $105 million. Discovery Drive A 3,400-foot extension connecting North Hillside Road to Route 44 opened fall 2016, offering improved access to UConn's Storrs campus and the developing UConn Technology Park. Discovery Drive, will ease traffic congestion on Route 195, especially during major campus events. The project includes a two-lane road, bike lane, and sidewalk, as well as essential utilities for the Tech Park.

Gampel Pavilion Roof Repairs Opening in 1990, the domed ceiling's construction was innovative for its time. Over time and as Gampel has aged, the fabric of the ceiling panels has started to tear and flake and the sealant between the panels has started to wear off. The repairs involved included dislodging each panel from the ceiling, lowering it to the ground, replacing the covering and insulation, and then raising it up for reinstallation. On the exterior, the roof was resealed and a new and safer access system was installed for workers to reach the roof when needed. The work will be completed before the start of the 2017-18 basketball season.

Over the past three decades, we have built state-of-the-art facilities that foster imagination, cultivate relationships, and advance innovation. Like  UCONN 2000  and  21st Century UConn  before it,  Next Generation Connecticut , the state's 10-year, $1.5 billion initiative that began in 2014, transformed our facilities statewide, strengthening our research and education. The sampling of projects outlined below represents key investments that allowed UConn to maintain its world-class status for future generations.

The plan assessed buildings, sites, open space, and infrastructure systems to provide a framework for advancing aspirations of our institution and achieving goals set by its academic vision. The plan was comprehensive and integrated - optimizing an opportunity to create an environment where ideas, imagination, and creativity can flourish. Completed in 2015 and capitalizing on  Next Generation Connecticut's  focus on STEM education and growing the research enterprise, the Master Plan drove transformative change in every aspect of academic and student life with an emphasis on excellence, community, inspiration, and innovation.  A copy of the document is available for viewing at masterplan.uconn.edu. 2016 Peter J.  Werth Residence Hall A new 212,000-square-foot residential facility opened for the Fall 2016 semester for students participating in one of eight Living & Learning Communities at UConn who are developing skills in innovation and creativity to lead their generation. Construction began in November 2014 with a budget of $105 million. Discovery Drive A 3,400-foot extension connecting North Hillside Road to Route 44 opened fall 2016, offering improved access to UConn's Storrs campus and the developing UConn Technology Park. Discovery Drive, will ease traffic congestion on Route 195, especially during major campus events. The project includes a two-lane road, bike lane, and sidewalk, as well as essential utilities for the Tech Park.

Gampel Pavilion Roof Repairs Opening in 1990, the domed ceiling's construction was innovative for its time. Over time and as Gampel has aged, the fabric of the ceiling panels has started to tear and flake and the sealant between the panels has started to wear off. The repairs involved included dislodging each panel from the ceiling, lowering it to the ground, replacing the covering and insulation, and then raising it up for reinstallation. On the exterior, the roof was resealed and a new and safer access system was installed for workers to reach the roof when needed. The work will be completed before the start of the 2017-18 basketball season.
