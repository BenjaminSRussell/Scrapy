Over the past three decades, we have built state-of-the-art facilities that foster imagination, cultivate relationships, and advance innovation. Like  UCONN 2000  and  21st Century UConn  before it,  Next Generation Connecticut , the state's 10-year, $1.5 billion initiative that began in 2014, transformed our facilities statewide, strengthening our research and education. The sampling of projects outlined below represents key investments that allowed UConn to maintain its world-class status for future generations.

The plan assessed buildings, sites, open space, and infrastructure systems to provide a framework for advancing aspirations of our institution and achieving goals set by its academic vision. The plan was comprehensive and integrated - optimizing an opportunity to create an environment where ideas, imagination, and creativity can flourish. Completed in 2015 and capitalizing on  Next Generation Connecticut's  focus on STEM education and growing the research enterprise, the Master Plan drove transformative change in every aspect of academic and student life with an emphasis on excellence, community, inspiration, and innovation.  A copy of the document is available for viewing at masterplan.uconn.edu. 2016 Peter J.  Werth Residence Hall A new 212,000-square-foot residential facility opened for the Fall 2016 semester for students participating in one of eight Living & Learning Communities at UConn who are developing skills in innovation and creativity to lead their generation. Construction began in November 2014 with a budget of $105 million. Discovery Drive A 3,400-foot extension connecting North Hillside Road to Route 44 opened fall 2016, offering improved access to UConn's Storrs campus and the developing UConn Technology Park. Discovery Drive, will ease traffic congestion on Route 195, especially during major campus events. The project includes a two-lane road, bike lane, and sidewalk, as well as essential utilities for the Tech Park.

Gampel Pavilion Roof Repairs Opening in 1990, the domed ceiling's construction was innovative for its time. Over time and as Gampel has aged, the fabric of the ceiling panels has started to tear and flake and the sealant between the panels has started to wear off. The repairs involved included dislodging each panel from the ceiling, lowering it to the ground, replacing the covering and insulation, and then raising it up for reinstallation. On the exterior, the roof was resealed and a new and safer access system was installed for workers to reach the roof when needed. The work will be completed before the start of the 2017-18 basketball season.

Over the past three decades, we have built state-of-the-art facilities that foster imagination, cultivate relationships, and advance innovation. Like  UCONN 2000  and  21st Century UConn  before it,  Next Generation Connecticut , the state's 10-year, $1.5 billion initiative that began in 2014, transformed our facilities statewide, strengthening our research and education. The sampling of projects outlined below represents key investments that allowed UConn to maintain its world-class status for future generations.

The plan assessed buildings, sites, open space, and infrastructure systems to provide a framework for advancing aspirations of our institution and achieving goals set by its academic vision. The plan was comprehensive and integrated - optimizing an opportunity to create an environment where ideas, imagination, and creativity can flourish. Completed in 2015 and capitalizing on  Next Generation Connecticut's  focus on STEM education and growing the research enterprise, the Master Plan drove transformative change in every aspect of academic and student life with an emphasis on excellence, community, inspiration, and innovation.  A copy of the document is available for viewing at masterplan.uconn.edu. 2016 Peter J.  Werth Residence Hall A new 212,000-square-foot residential facility opened for the Fall 2016 semester for students participating in one of eight Living & Learning Communities at UConn who are developing skills in innovation and creativity to lead their generation. Construction began in November 2014 with a budget of $105 million. Discovery Drive A 3,400-foot extension connecting North Hillside Road to Route 44 opened fall 2016, offering improved access to UConn's Storrs campus and the developing UConn Technology Park. Discovery Drive, will ease traffic congestion on Route 195, especially during major campus events. The project includes a two-lane road, bike lane, and sidewalk, as well as essential utilities for the Tech Park.

Gampel Pavilion Roof Repairs Opening in 1990, the domed ceiling's construction was innovative for its time. Over time and as Gampel has aged, the fabric of the ceiling panels has started to tear and flake and the sealant between the panels has started to wear off. The repairs involved included dislodging each panel from the ceiling, lowering it to the ground, replacing the covering and insulation, and then raising it up for reinstallation. On the exterior, the roof was resealed and a new and safer access system was installed for workers to reach the roof when needed. The work will be completed before the start of the 2017-18 basketball season.

Over the past three decades, we have built state-of-the-art facilities that foster imagination, cultivate relationships, and advance innovation. Like  UCONN 2000  and  21st Century UConn  before it,  Next Generation Connecticut , the state's 10-year, $1.5 billion initiative that began in 2014, transformed our facilities statewide, strengthening our research and education. The sampling of projects outlined below represents key investments that allowed UConn to maintain its world-class status for future generations.

The plan assessed buildings, sites, open space, and infrastructure systems to provide a framework for advancing aspirations of our institution and achieving goals set by its academic vision. The plan was comprehensive and integrated - optimizing an opportunity to create an environment where ideas, imagination, and creativity can flourish. Completed in 2015 and capitalizing on  Next Generation Connecticut's  focus on STEM education and growing the research enterprise, the Master Plan drove transformative change in every aspect of academic and student life with an emphasis on excellence, community, inspiration, and innovation.  A copy of the document is available for viewing at masterplan.uconn.edu. 2016 Peter J.  Werth Residence Hall A new 212,000-square-foot residential facility opened for the Fall 2016 semester for students participating in one of eight Living & Learning Communities at UConn who are developing skills in innovation and creativity to lead their generation. Construction began in November 2014 with a budget of $105 million. Discovery Drive A 3,400-foot extension connecting North Hillside Road to Route 44 opened fall 2016, offering improved access to UConn's Storrs campus and the developing UConn Technology Park. Discovery Drive, will ease traffic congestion on Route 195, especially during major campus events. The project includes a two-lane road, bike lane, and sidewalk, as well as essential utilities for the Tech Park.

Gampel Pavilion Roof Repairs Opening in 1990, the domed ceiling's construction was innovative for its time. Over time and as Gampel has aged, the fabric of the ceiling panels has started to tear and flake and the sealant between the panels has started to wear off. The repairs involved included dislodging each panel from the ceiling, lowering it to the ground, replacing the covering and insulation, and then raising it up for reinstallation. On the exterior, the roof was resealed and a new and safer access system was installed for workers to reach the roof when needed. The work will be completed before the start of the 2017-18 basketball season.

Over the past three decades, we have built state-of-the-art facilities that foster imagination, cultivate relationships, and advance innovation. Like  UCONN 2000  and  21st Century UConn  before it,  Next Generation Connecticut , the state's 10-year, $1.5 billion initiative that began in 2014, transformed our facilities statewide, strengthening our research and education. The sampling of projects outlined below represents key investments that allowed UConn to maintain its world-class status for future generations.

The plan assessed buildings, sites, open space, and infrastructure systems to provide a framework for advancing aspirations of our institution and achieving goals set by its academic vision. The plan was comprehensive and integrated - optimizing an opportunity to create an environment where ideas, imagination, and creativity can flourish. Completed in 2015 and capitalizing on  Next Generation Connecticut's  focus on STEM education and growing the research enterprise, the Master Plan drove transformative change in every aspect of academic and student life with an emphasis on excellence, community, inspiration, and innovation.  A copy of the document is available for viewing at masterplan.uconn.edu. 2016 Peter J.  Werth Residence Hall A new 212,000-square-foot residential facility opened for the Fall 2016 semester for students participating in one of eight Living & Learning Communities at UConn who are developing skills in innovation and creativity to lead their generation. Construction began in November 2014 with a budget of $105 million. Discovery Drive A 3,400-foot extension connecting North Hillside Road to Route 44 opened fall 2016, offering improved access to UConn's Storrs campus and the developing UConn Technology Park. Discovery Drive, will ease traffic congestion on Route 195, especially during major campus events. The project includes a two-lane road, bike lane, and sidewalk, as well as essential utilities for the Tech Park.

Gampel Pavilion Roof Repairs Opening in 1990, the domed ceiling's construction was innovative for its time. Over time and as Gampel has aged, the fabric of the ceiling panels has started to tear and flake and the sealant between the panels has started to wear off. The repairs involved included dislodging each panel from the ceiling, lowering it to the ground, replacing the covering and insulation, and then raising it up for reinstallation. On the exterior, the roof was resealed and a new and safer access system was installed for workers to reach the roof when needed. The work will be completed before the start of the 2017-18 basketball season.

Students have the right to have some control over the disclosure of information from the records. Educational institutions have the responsibility to prevent improper disclosure of personally identifiable information from the records. Students have a right to know about the purposes, content, and location of information kept as part of their educational records. They have a right to gain access to and challenge the content of their educational records. FERPA was not intended to provide a process to be used to question substantive judgments that are correctly recorded. The rights of challenge are not intended to allow students to contest, for example, a grade in a course because they felt a higher grade should have been assigned. Students also have a right to expect that information in their educational records will be kept confidential, disclosed only with their permission or under provisions of the law. Student educational records are specifically defined as records, files, documents, and other materials that contain information directly related to a student and maintained by the University or someone acting for the University according to policy. Excluded from student educational records are records of instructional, supervisory, and administrative personnel and ancillary educational personnel in the sole possession of the maker and that are not accessible or revealed to any other person, except for a substitute. Additionally, notes of a professor or staff member intended for his or her own use are not part of the educational record, nor are records of police services, application records of students not admitted to the University, alumni records, or records of physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or other recognized professionals. Records relating to an individual who is employed by the University not as a result of his or her status as a student are also excluded. However, employment records relating to University students who are employed as a result of their status as students are considered educational records. FERPA Policy The University’s FERPA Policy provides important information on the protection of student rights and privacy at UConn. The policy outlines student rights, when we may share information from education records, and the process for challenging the accuracy of education records.

Students also have the ability to provide permission for certain offices at UConn to discuss records held or managed by that office and/or services provided to the student through that office. Different processes are required for each of these options. This page provides you with information on the various ways students can provide the University with the documentation it needs to share certain records or discuss their contents where prior written consent is required. FERPA Tips for Families Overview for Students As a current or former student, the information contained in your education records at UConn is protected by a Federal privacy law known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  Under FERPA, you have certain rights related to your education records, including the right to have access to your own education records, and the right to have control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from your education records (except in certain circumstances specified in the FERPA regulations).   FERPA also requires University faculty, staff, vendors and affiliates (otherwise known as “school officials”) to protect your education records and the information contained in those records, and to only share the contents of those records in accordance with FERPA’s requirements.  Except under limited exceptions specified in FERPA, school officials can only share your education records or discuss your records with your “prior written consent”—that is, your explicit permission in writing. There may be times when students want to share certain records with someone outside the University or have that person contact a University office to discuss some aspect of their education records or information contained in your education records.  This page provides you with information on the various ways students can provide the University with the documentation it needs to share certain records or discuss their contents where prior written consent is required. Navigating “Prior Written Consent” At UConn, students may provide direct access to certain portions of the education records.  Students also have the ability to provide permission for certain offices at UConn to discuss records held or managed by that office and/or services provided to the student through that office.  Different processes are required for each of these options. Access to View Student Records Certain student records can be viewed electronically by individuals for whom a student has set up an account, designating that person as a “Delegate” who may access certain screens or content.  These records fall into three (3) main categories:  academic/registrar, financial/bursar and financial aid. Delegated Access The Delegated Access feature of the Student Administration System provides students with the option to provide access to view certain screens in their PeopleSoft account to whomever they choose (for example: your parent, spouse, employer).  This allows the person to whom they choose to give this access (their “Delegate”) the ability to see certain screens in the Student Administration System that the Student selects for them to view. By setting up delegated access, you are giving your prior written consent required for school officials of the University of Connecticut to give the individual(s) you specify as Delegate(s), access to the information you have specified within the Student Administration System. Delegates will be able to view different screens of your information based what education records you have permitted them to access. Please know that you are entitled to change, amend or rescind this permission at any time. In order to change this permission, simply visit the Delegated Access page and edit your delegates or the access they may have accordingly. Please note that giving your Delegate(s) access to view certain screens in the Student Administration System does not also provide the required consent for the University offices that are the custodians of the contents of those screens for the University to answer questions from your Delegate(s). In order to provide the required consent for University offices to speak about the contents of those screens, please visit  FERPA Manager . Students can set up delegated access at   https://studentadmin.uconn.edu/ . Create an Authorize User for Payments and Payment Plan (Flywire) The student may identify a parent, guardian, spouse, or employer to make payments on the student’s behalf as an authorized user. The authorized user will also be able to enroll in one of the optional installment payment plans and view current financial activity. Student adds an Authorized User to Account in Flywire Log in at http://studentadmin.uconn.edu, and select the “Bursar Services” tile. Click on “Pay Bill and Authorize Users” to get to the Flywire Payment Homepage. Select “Manage Authorized Users” option from the “Actions” menu in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Select the option to add an Authorized User, then enter their name and email address. An email will be sent to the Authorized User email for them to select a password and create their official Flywire account. Authorized User Requests Access Authorized User selects “Create New Account” on the   Flywire homepage . Click “No” when asked if you are a current of former student. Authorized User completes the “Create Your Authorized User Account” (name, email, password). Next, the Authorized User receives an email to verify his/her email address and to activate the account. The Authorized User is prompted to login to Flywire with email address/password. The Authorized User is required to verify the student’s ID number and date of birth. Flywire sends an email to the student indicating that the Authorized User has requested access to the student’s account in flywire. Once approved, the Authorized User receives notification that the Authorized User has been established. If the student does not approve, the AU account will remain in pending status. Granting Permission for University Staff to Discuss Certain Types of Student Information FERPA Designee Pin Page The University’s FERPA Designee Pin Page allows students to grant permission to certain University staff to discuss certain types of information related to their education records or information contained in student records with individuals specifically designated by the student. Students may log into   FERPA Manager   to designate anyone – (e.g., a parent, a guardian, a significant other, employer) to grant permission for University staff to discuss the categories of information listed below.  The individual a student designates is called the student’s “FERPA Designee.”  Students will enter the following information into the FERPA Designee Pin Page for each person they choose to designate 1) proper name (first and last name) of the designee 2) assign each designee a 4-digit pass code 3) select what categories of information they give permission for University staff to discuss. After the FERPA Designee Pin Page is completed, students should make sure that each designee knows their 4-digit pin code and what categories of information they have granted permission for University staff to discuss. When a designee contacts an office they will be asked to provide their name and their 4-digit pin code. Names and pass codes must match what is listed on the FERPA Designee Pin Page in order for University staff to discuss information specific to a student’s education record. Note:   The FERPA Designee Pin Page   may not be used to disclose copies of education records .  The FERPA Designee Pin Page only covers discussions regarding student information, not the disclosure of the records themselves.   For information regarding the process to disclose copies of student records, please see the section regarding “Disclosing or Sharing Other Records” above. It is important to note that the FERPA Designee Pin Page does not cover every topic of discussion.  Nor does it cover discussions will all University employees about a student.  Offices not listed above may require that a student follow the process described in the “Disclosing or Sharing Other Records” section above before discussing any matter about a student.  Further University staff may determine when additional consent of the Student is required.  In such cases, University staff may require that the processes outlined in the “Disclosing or Sharing Other Records” section above be followed before discussions regarding a student may occur. Additionally,   please note the FERPA Pin Page DOES NOT apply to discussions with faculty .  Discussions with faculty should also utilize the process outlined in the “Disclosing or Sharing Other Records” section above. The FERPA Designee Pin Page permits certain University offices to discuss the following categories of information: Academic & Advising Information : Academic progress including final and mid-semester grades, grade point averages, academic standing, registration planning, course selection and current enrollment(this does not include times and locations of courses), holds related to academic issues, enrollment appointment times, and communication with advisors, including information contained in forms and petitions.

When in doubt about the proper custodian, contact the University Registrar or the University Privacy Officer. DO keep only those individual student records necessary for the fulfillment of your teaching and advising responsibilities. Private notes of a faculty member concerning a student and intended for the faculty member’s own use are not part of the student’s educational records. DO keep any personal professional records relating to individual students separate from their educational records. Private records of instructional, supervisory, and administrative personnel and ancillary educational personnel are to be kept in the sole possession of the maker and are not to be accessible or revealed to any other person, except a substitute. DO change factual information regarding grades and performance in an educational record when the student is able to provide valid documentation that information is inaccurate or misleading. The substantive judgement of a faculty member about a student’s work, expressed in grades and/or evaluations, is not within the purview of students’ right to challenge their educational records. DO NOT display student scores or grades publicly in association with names, Social Security Numbers, or other personal identifiers. If scores or grades are posted, use some code known only to you and the individual student. Even a partial Social Security Number should not be used. In no case should the list be posted in alphabetic sequence by student name. DO NOT put papers, graded exams books, or lab reports containing student names and grades in publicly accessible places. Students are not to have access to the scores and grades of others in class in ways that allow other students to be identified. DO NOT request information from the educational record custodian without a legitimate educational interest and the appropriate authority to do so. DO NOT share student educational record information, including grades or grade point averages, with other faculty or staff members of the University unless their official responsibilities identify their “legitimate educational interest” in that information for that student. DO NOT share information from student educational records, including grades or grade point averages, with parents or others outside the institution, including in letters of recommendation, without written permission from the student. WHEN IN DOUBT, err on the side of caution and do not release student educational information. Contact the University Registrar or the University Privacy Officer for guidance. Distance Learning Privacy Considerations If you are an instructor teaching a distance learning course this semester, you may find yourself implementing certain practices and proctoring tools to authenticate a student’s identity and/or to promote academic integrity. For example, you may decide to use a remote monitoring tool to proctor your exams or ask that a student participate using their computer’s camera. If you require student monitoring of any kind for your course, or intend to record lectures with students present, please inform your students in writing as early as possible in the semester (e.g. notice on your syllabus or email to the class). This will allow students an opportunity to anticipate and resolve any potential privacy concerns they may have in taking the course. By providing transparency of monitoring practices, students are clearly notified of course expectations and generally required to comply with limited exceptions. Flexibility for students is encouraged wherever possible. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t©  University of Connecticut Disclaimers, Privacy & Copyright Accessibility Webmaster Login A-Z Index", "word_count": 1409, "entities": ["Navigation Skip", "UConn Search Skip", "University Websites Privacy Notice", "UConn Cookie Information What are Cookies", "HTTP", "Personalization", "Tracking & Analytics", "Types of Cookies", "First-Party Cookies", "Third-Party Cookies", "Commonly", "Prevents", "What's Inside an Authentication Cookie?", "Optional", "Click", "1", "three", "Cookies", "third", "2", "Mozilla Firefox Open Firefox", "Privacy & Security", "Enhanced Tracking Protection", "3", "Safari", "4", "Microsoft Edge Open Edge", "5.", "Mobile", "Chrome", "Android", "UConn", "University of Connecticut                             Search University of Connecticut", "Z", "Z Index Site A-Z", "A-Z Office of University Compliance UConn Privacy Search this Site Search", "Search Toggle", "Menu UConn Privacy Skip", "Home FERPA FERPA Overview FERPA Consent", "Login", "Search Guidelines for Faculty and Staff", "the University Privacy Officer", "Social Security Numbers", "Social Security", "University", "DOUBT", "Distance Learning Privacy Considerations", "University of Connecticut Disclaimers"], "keywords": ["cookie", "student", "privacy", "information", "record", "use", "educational", "website", "grade", "search", "university", "site", "block", "ferpa", "uconn"], "content_tags": [], "has_pdf_links": false, "has_audio_links": false, "status_code": 200, "content_type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "enriched_at": "2025-09-30T14:58:15.996799", "processed_at": "2025-09-30T14:58:16.373520"}
